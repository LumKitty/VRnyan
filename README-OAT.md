# QuickStart Instructions for using LIVnyan with OnAirTap instead of LIV

## Prerequisites
* VNyan
  * SteamVR tracking configured and working
  * Spout2 output configured and working
  * (Recommended) a .VSFAvatar model
  * (Optional) My [Extras Plugin](https://github.com/LumKitty/LumsExtras/) to prevent accidentally resizing VNyan while in VR
* OBS
  * [Spout2](https://github.com/Off-World-Live/obs-spout2-plugin) plugin
  * [Advanced Mask](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/advanced-masks.1856/) plugin
* OnAirTap
  * Understanding of how to mod your chosen game (BepInEx or BSIPA)
  * Your game uses the LIV 1.5 SDK (If LIV_Bridge.dll is present it should work. If it has LIV_Native.dll or no LIV dlls then your game will not work)
* General
  * A sufficiently powerful PC
  * Understanding of OBS filters
  * Understanding of the Windows filesystem, DLL files, JSON files etc.

## Installation  
* Download the latest version from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/LumKitty/LIVnyan/releases) - needs to be at least 1.3a2
* Enable plugins in VNyan settings, if not already enabled  
* Copy VNyan-LIV.dll into the VNyan\Items\Assemblies folder  

## OnAirTap setup - BepInEx
* Download the latest version of [OnAirTap](https://github.com/milkydelta/OnAirTap)
* Install the latest version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/bepinex/bepinex) following its instructions
* Install the mod by unpacking the OpenBrush build. If you are attempting to use this with a different game you will need to use a different directory for OAT_KlakSpout.dll instead of OpenBrush_Data. Typically it will be GameName_Data
* Start the game once and quit
* Edit <GAMEDIR>\BepInEx\config\OnAirTap.cfg
* Recommended initial settings:
  ```
  [ClipPlanes]
  (leave everything as default)
  
  [OAT_MMF_Data]
  ReadWindowResolution = true
  ReadClipPlaneLocation = true
  ProtocolMinorVersion = 1

  [RenderPasses]
  RenderBackground = true
  RenderForeground = true
  RenderOptimised = false
  SendBackground = true
  SendForeground = true
  SendOptimised = false
  BlankSendersOnRenderDispose = true
  (leave everything else as default)
  ```
* Start VNyan and press the LIVnyan button to enable sending data. If successful your model should appear smaller than usual, due to the necessary camera changes
* Start your game

## OBS Setup
* Create a Spout2 capture named "OnAirTap-BG". Choose the SpoutSender "OnAirTap Background", with Composite Mode set to Opaque
* Immediately above this, create a Spout2 capture for VNyan with Composite Mode set to default
* Create a Spout2 capture named "OnAirTap-FG". Choose the SpoutSender "OnAirTap Foreground", with Composite Mode set to Opaque
* Right click OnAirTap-FG -> Blending Mode -> Add
* Right click OnAirTap-FG -> Filters
* Hit the + button and add an effect filter "Advanced Mask". Set the following settings:  
  Mask Effect: Alpha Mask  
  Mask Type: Source  
  Source: VNyan  
  Scaling: Manual  
  Scale By: Percent (preserve aspect ratio)  
  Scale: 100%  
  Filter On: Alpha Channel  
  (all other settings should be default)
* Create a Spout2 capture named "OnAirTap-FG2". Choose the SpoutSender "OnAirTap Foreground", with Composite Mode set to Default
* (Optional) group these up.

## OnAirTap setup - Beat Saber
* Setup is the same as for BepInEx except you do not need to install BepInEx, the config file is now <GAMEDIR>\UserData\OnAirTap.json and it is not split into individual sections. The following settings should be changed:
  ```
  "ShouldRenderBG": true,
  "ShouldRenderFG": true,
  "ShouldRenderOptimised": true,
  "ShouldReadResolutionFromMMF": true,
  "ShouldReadTrackerFromMMF": true,
  "ShouldSendBG": true,
  "ShouldSendFG": true,
  "ShouldSendOptimised": true,
  "BlankSpoutOnRenderDispose": false,
  "MMFProtocolMinorVersion": 1,
  (leave everything else as default)
  ```
* OBS setup is the same except instead of OnAirTap-FG2 create OnAirTap-OP. Choose the SpoutSender "OnAirTap Optimised", with composite mode set to default

Note: It is not necessary to remove or deactivate OnAirTap if not streaming/compositing. OnAirTap will not activate its additional rendering unless VNyan is running and LIVnyan is activated. The only exception is if you want to use LIV instead

For more efficient setups, and Linux support, see the main OnAirTap readme
